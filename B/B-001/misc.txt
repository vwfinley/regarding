How do I draw RP-25?  Not an easy answer.  But a very rich learning exercise.
Must be understood in context of fuller system of standards and RPs.
Interchangability.  Interchangeable parts from different producers, in different places at different times.
Really how do I deal with inperfection?
Tolerances are difference between math and engineering.
Perfection vs. real world.
Real world is not perfect.
Even if you could measure with infinite you would eventually measure a deviation from ideal.
Manufacturing variation.  Between manufacturers, but also batches, parts.
Variation in rail height, bumpts and dips.  Rail spread and constrictions.  Twists.
Level (lack of) of maintance.
Weather.  Freeze/thaw cycle heaving.  Erosion.  Saturation of sub bed.
Dimensional change.  Materials change with temperature.  Temperature change is not uniform everywhere for all materials. Rails and wheels (tires) are wear parts, they change dimension over service-life as they wear.
What is needed, is the "idealized" design AND a system to deal with variations over time and space.
How much inperfection can be tolerated?  What is the acceptable worst-case scenario that still works?

Quite an engineering achievement.  Solution to a difficult problem.  More so to align interests of many different vendors, modelers, clubs, etc. over many decades.

To understand RP-25 look at nmra RP-2 standards gage.
On wheels side, gage is really a proxy for the rails (and all it's variations).
On: track, points, flangeways sides, gage is really a proxy for the wheelset.(and all it's variations).

Gage point is not origin!!!

RP-15.1  note railhead flat on top.  Railhead has two points-of-contact with wheel top (along C/R) and side (along H).  Wheel has two points-of-contact with railhead (flange tangent) and (gage point).

In truth there are many solutions to the wheel profile problem.
Gage acts as an envelop of a few critical dimensions and tolerances.
Standard gage (wheels): Does wheel fit in the slot(s)?
Primitive box profile.  Tread and flange.  Does it fit?
Point of tread contact.  Clearance (fillet rolloff vs. railhead radius).  Gage point and gage point point-of-contact
S-4.2 Dmax.  Flange can be shorter but not taller.
S-4.2 tolerance of K, B and Tmax requirement.  Almost like a budget, you can spend tolerance on K and/or B but total tolerance cannot exceed Tmax.
Gage has rounded bottom wheel slot.  Flange must fit in this envelope.  Otherwise box flange would work.  Okay, round off bottom of flange so now standard is satisfied.


# Abstract
- Perplexing
- Disambiguation
- How to you draw accurately with the given dimensions?
- How to construct?
- Parametric CAD?

# S1 Motivation
- Create dimensioned drawing
- Clear drawing prior to fabrication
- Tools, dies, molds



# S2 Machining
- Basic S-4.2 blocky wheel
- RP not standard
- In truth, many profiles are a solution...
- Leading to different unstated interpretatons per manufacturer calling themselves "RP25".
- Most will turn S-4.2 block wheel on lathe...
- ...and round over the flange with file.
- Laborous, not repeatable
- Tooling would assure accuracy from wheel to wheel and speed process.

# S3 Errors
- Units are unstated.  Assuming inches?
- How was the RP25 contour determined? Is there a forumula or was it ad-hoc?  Based upon existing vendor's products?  Interface with track standards?
- OK, D' does vary from D for some codes, but why differentiate between N and N' when no tolerance given?
- Note #2 how was "reasonable tolerance" determined? Based on track standard?
- Note #3 what is meant by Gaging Point? Is related to nmra gauge (inspection tool)? Gauge vs. gage.  
- Note #3 "point of tangency between R1 and R2" implies A-004 Class B single tangent.  (A-003 case 8) Circles are tangent to each other.
- Note #3 "point of crossing of R2 with the inside of the wheel" is not possible since center of R2 is above the "P" line.
- Note #3 is P a point or distance?  Vague.  If distance from/to where?  If distance where is gaging point P?
- Note #4 is vague.  What does "large as possible" mean?  Why not just state some tolerances?
- Note #5 Worn wheels on prototype or model? 
	- Is reverse taper deseriable?
	- Will reverse taper help center?
	- Is reverse table above or below horizontal tread line?
	- Can tread be 0 deg (horizontal)?
- Drawing: Where is the origin?  At the "gaging point" P?
- Drawing: How were construction lines for R1 determined?
- Drawing: Flange depth is geometrically incorrect for stated value of D'.  Flange will be too short.
- Drawing: Is there a tangent line between R1 and R2?  
	- This cannot be vertical as it won't connect to R2.  Discontinuous or require left offset of R2.
- Drawing: Where are centers of R1, R2, R3?
- Drawing: R2 & R3 form ogive.  Thus arc between them centered at bottom of flange (ogive check).
- Drawing: R2 & R3 where are the vertical bi-secting arcs centered?
- Drawing: Why are R2 & R3 arrows shown in different positions?
- Drawing: Right N' vertical line has discontunity where it meets R3.  R3 center above "P" horiz "axis".
- Drawing: shows 0 deg tread slope, can slope also be between 0 and 1?  Disagrees with note 5.

Assuming we want continuous segments, no discontinuities.
analyze in two halves, left & right
straight segment.  vertical?
left: A-001 & A-002 circles, tangent lines & fillets
right: A-006 & A-007 ogives
connecting segment: A-003, 4, 5

# S4 Construction
Step 0:
Strategy: Draw tread, draw axes, draw the envelop (of the standard) construction lines, join sides, cleanup

Step 1: (Left side, the tread)
Draw circle of radius R1
Radius line to tangent point
Tread w/ taper from tangent point

Step 2:
Drop gaging line P from tangent point (x-axis)
Vertical line (y-axis) where x-axis intersects R1

Step 3: (Right Side, the flange)
Draw ogive
See spreadsheet.

Step 4: (Join together Left & Right sides)
There is a dependency on tread angle, as this will change location of R1 tangent point.  This will change location of P gage line.
Connect R1 to ogive
3 approaches
	a. Live with the discontinuity at P.  R1 abrubtly intersects vertical line.  Reference http://dda40x.blog.jp/archives/51972132.html regarding NMRA "advice".
	b. Approach "a" above but "blend" the discontinutity with some filing.  May change gaging point slightly.  Will this deepen the flange?
	c. Or use techniques of A-004 to find a common tangent between R1 and R2.  Won't be vertical.  May shift gaging point slightly to right (within "tolerance"? 0.001???) Will this deepen the flange?

Step 5: Non-critical radius on tread edge (break the corner)
May be useful for tooling or CNC

# Theorems
- Bisecting an isosceles triangle.
- Euclid's Elements Redux : Daniel Callahan : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive
	- Page 161, Proposition 3.12. Intersecting Circles 1.
	- Page 186 Proposition 3.28
- Page 143 Proposition 3.1. THE CENTER OF A CIRCLE I.

# Summary
- Three critical points
- Locating R1 and R2 is the core of the problem.  Focus on that.
- Depth point is also important.
# Procedure
- Select Code
- Draw axes
- Draw construction lines (label them)
- Locate R1
- Draw center line R1 thru origin, extend
- Draw arc from origin a distance R2 along center line.
- Sweep R2 from mark on centerline
- Reflect R2 across flange middleline to get R3.

- Result is short and broad, far from max depth
- If you are happy with the profile, great, then skip ahead to taper section.
- If you want to make adjustments, continue reading next section.

# Adjustments
- Two (three) adjustments
- The slide: Slide R2 along centerline
- The see-saw: Adjust slope/pitch of the centerline
- Flange depth

## The slide
- R1 fixed
- Marking off arbitrary R2
- setting depth desired/full depth

## The see-saw (lever)
- Two points (locations of R1 &R2) control see-saw centerline slope/pitch 
- R1 first or R2 first
- Arbitrary R1
- Arbitrary R2
  - box center
  - Impact on R1, how to calculate R1

## Depth adjustment








# Historic context
- Developed during time of slide rules
- before personal computers.
- Most hobbiests are not engineers, machinists.
- Most hobbiests are unfamiliar with trigonometry and analytic geometry.
- Maybe familar with constructive geometry 

# Strategy
- Constructive geometry
- Then analytic geometry to make drawing on CAD easier.
- Draw tread, Draw flange
- Reduce problem to essence.  Trying to find the centers of 3 circles such they are arranged in a specific way.  We are just trying to arrange 3 circles.
- Find R2 center given Constraints(Conditions) 
	- Constraint A: Radius is R2=0.018
	- Constraint B: Tangent to R1 at Pg (passes thru Pg, Pg is on R2 circle)
	- Constraint C: Passes thru ogive tip (tip is on R2 circle)
- All three constrains cannot be satisfied.
	- Case 1 (cyan): Constraints AB, C not satisfied 
		- (Pg is on circle, but not tangent, discontinuity at Pg, furthermore ogive tip not on circle(bad!))
		- Disagrees with RP25 note 3
		- Flange too short, too flat and broad.
		- Some have suggested to drop R2 circle down and connect R1 and R2 with a vertical line.  
			- Results in 2 discontinuities where R1 intersects vert line and where R2 intersects vert line
		- A sloped connecting tangent line may work.
		- Eitherway R2 center must be lowered (hackish!) and R2 won't be tangent to R1.
			
	- Case 2 (yellow): Constraints AC, B not satisfied (Pg is on circle, but not tangent, discontinuity at Pg, ogive tip on circle (better! no hacks required))
		- Disagrees with RP25 note 3

	- Case 3 (white): Constraints BC, A not satisfied (although a new R2' can be calculated, best!)
		- R2 and R1 will be tangent at Pg.  No discontinuity at Pg. (ok)
		- Ogive tip is on R2 (ok)
		- Results in narrower/sharper ogive (ok, looks better, more clearance when gaged)
		- Method to determine R2' center must be found (bi-sect isosceles triangle)
		- New values for R2' and R3' must be calculated (ok, no problem)


- Drawing order suggested by the spec authors
- R1, R2, R3
- or R3, R2, R1???  Results in treadline above P. 

# R1 location
- Discussion of R1 location.
- Gage point should be referenced from 0deg treadline.  
- Otherwise relationship between tread and flange changes.
- Discussion of taper angle.  
- Inspection gage designed to make contact at gage point Pg.  Fillet radius bears against the fillet.  Until taper point.  Beyond the tread taper rises.
- 3deg layout lines

# R2 location
- Draw
- Problem
- Ambiguous.  
- Draw R2, no tangent with R1.  Centers unconnected.  Differs with the note.
- How are centers of R2 & R3 determined.  Notes text, Doesn't agree with drawing.

- Approaches fall in to two categories
	- ignore the point gage point (Pg) requirement
	- ignore the published values of R2 & R3, calculate new values R2' and R3'
- Three suggested solutions
	- None guaranteed to pass NMRA gage test.  
	- Performance may vary.  
	- Selection depends on materials (metal vs. plastic), process (casting, forging, machining), tooling vs. moulding
1) Vertical connecting line.  Pros: simple to draw, Cons: discontinuity
2) Tangent connecting line.  Pros: smooth transition, Cons: harder to find tangent points
3) Change published values of R2, R3.  Pros: easy to draw, complies with (Pg) tangent requirement,  Cons: R3 discontinuity at wheelback, must be calculated.
  - How to locate centerpoint.  bi-sect isosceles triangle method
4) Custom solution flange=square, round, angled

# R3 location


- The goal is to get a profile what fits inside envelope of the s4.2 standard.
- In theory many solutions to the problem if stated as profile must fit standard.  
	- Many profiles have been proposed and manufactured.  
	- Reference MR article.
- In practice many solutions fit the NMRA test gage profile.
- Profile could have 

# Tables
- Solution 1,2,3 inch/mm
- Calculate values for R2 & R3.
- Locate all critical points.  Circle centers, tangent points, ogive tip, etc.


How do I draw RP-25?  Not an easy answer.  But a very rich learning exercise.
Must be understood in context of fuller system of standards and RPs.
Interchangability.  Interchangeable parts from different producers, in different places at different times.
Really how do I deal with inperfection?
Tolerances are difference between math and engineering.
Perfection vs. real world.
Real world is not perfect.
Even if you could measure with infinite you would eventually measure a deviation from ideal.
Manufacturing variation.  Between manufacturers, but also batches, parts.
Variation in rail height, bumpts and dips.  Rail spread and constrictions.  Twists.
Level (lack of) of maintance.
Weather.  Freeze/thaw cycle heaving.  Erosion.  Saturation of sub bed.
Dimensional change.  Materials change with temperature.  Temperature change is not uniform everywhere for all materials. Rails and wheels (tires) are wear parts, they change dimension over service-life as they wear.
What is needed, is the "idealized" design AND a system to deal with variations over time and space.
How much inperfection can be tolerated?  What is the acceptable worst-case scenario that still works?

Quite an engineering achievement.  Solution to a difficult problem.  More so to align interests of many different vendors, modelers, clubs, etc. over many decades.

To understand RP-25 look at nmra RP-2 standards gage.
On wheels side, gage is really a proxy for the rails (and all it's variations).
On: track, points, flangeways sides, gage is really a proxy for the wheelset.(and all it's variations).

Gage point is not origin!!!

RP-15.1  note railhead flat on top.  Railhead has two points-of-contact with wheel top (along C/R) and side (along H).  Wheel has two points-of-contact with railhead (flange tangent) and (gage point).

In truth there are many solutions to the wheel profile problem.
Gage acts as an envelop of a few critical dimensions and tolerances.
Standard gage (wheels): Does wheel fit in the slot(s)?
Primitive box profile.  Tread and flange.  Does it fit?
Point of tread contact.  Clearance (fillet rolloff vs. railhead radius).  Gage point and gage point point-of-contact
S-4.2 Dmax.  Flange can be shorter but not taller.
S-4.2 tolerance of K, B and Tmax requirement.  Almost like a budget, you can spend tolerance on K and/or B but total tolerance cannot exceed Tmax.
Gage has rounded bottom wheel slot.  Flange must fit in this envelope.  Otherwise box flange would work.  Okay, round off bottom of flange so now standard is satisfied.


# Abstract
- Perplexing
- Disambiguation
- How to you draw accurately with the given dimensions?
- How to construct?
- Parametric CAD?

# S1 Motivation
- Create dimensioned drawing
- Clear drawing prior to fabrication
- Tools, dies, molds



# S2 Machining
- Basic S-4.2 blocky wheel
- RP not standard
- In truth, many profiles are a solution...
- Leading to different unstated interpretatons per manufacturer calling themselves "RP25".
- Most will turn S-4.2 block wheel on lathe...
- ...and round over the flange with file.
- Laborous, not repeatable
- Tooling would assure accuracy from wheel to wheel and speed process.

# S3 Errors
- Units are unstated.  Assuming inches?
- How was the RP25 contour determined? Is there a forumula or was it ad-hoc?  Based upon existing vendor's products?  Interface with track standards?
- OK, D' does vary from D for some codes, but why differentiate between N and N' when no tolerance given?
- Note #2 how was "reasonable tolerance" determined? Based on track standard?
- Note #3 what is meant by Gaging Point? Is related to nmra gauge (inspection tool)? Gauge vs. gage.  
- Note #3 "point of tangency between R1 and R2" implies A-004 Class B single tangent.  (A-003 case 8) Circles are tangent to each other.
- Note #3 "point of crossing of R2 with the inside of the wheel" is not possible since center of R2 is above the "P" line.
- Note #3 is P a point or distance?  Vague.  If distance from/to where?  If distance where is gaging point P?
- Note #4 is vague.  What does "large as possible" mean?  Why not just state some tolerances?
- Note #5 Worn wheels on prototype or model? 
	- Is reverse taper deseriable?
	- Will reverse taper help center?
	- Is reverse table above or below horizontal tread line?
	- Can tread be 0 deg (horizontal)?
- Drawing: Where is the origin?  At the "gaging point" P?
- Drawing: How were construction lines for R1 determined?
- Drawing: Flange depth is geometrically incorrect for stated value of D'.  Flange will be too short.
- Drawing: Is there a tangent line between R1 and R2?  
	- This cannot be vertical as it won't connect to R2.  Discontinuous or require left offset of R2.
- Drawing: Where are centers of R1, R2, R3?
- Drawing: R2 & R3 form ogive.  Thus arc between them centered at bottom of flange (ogive check).
- Drawing: R2 & R3 where are the vertical bi-secting arcs centered?
- Drawing: Why are R2 & R3 arrows shown in different positions?
- Drawing: Right N' vertical line has discontunity where it meets R3.  R3 center above "P" horiz "axis".
- Drawing: shows 0 deg tread slope, can slope also be between 0 and 1?  Disagrees with note 5.

Assuming we want continuous segments, no discontinuities.
analyze in two halves, left & right
straight segment.  vertical?
left: A-001 & A-002 circles, tangent lines & fillets
right: A-006 & A-007 ogives
connecting segment: A-003, 4, 5

# S4 Construction
Step 0:
Strategy: Draw tread, draw axes, draw the envelop (of the standard) construction lines, join sides, cleanup

Step 1: (Left side, the tread)
Draw circle of radius R1
Radius line to tangent point
Tread w/ taper from tangent point

Step 2:
Drop gaging line P from tangent point (x-axis)
Vertical line (y-axis) where x-axis intersects R1

Step 3: (Right Side, the flange)
Draw ogive
See spreadsheet.

Step 4: (Join together Left & Right sides)
There is a dependency on tread angle, as this will change location of R1 tangent point.  This will change location of P gage line.
Connect R1 to ogive
3 approaches
	a. Live with the discontinuity at P.  R1 abrubtly intersects vertical line.  Reference http://dda40x.blog.jp/archives/51972132.html regarding NMRA "advice".
	b. Approach "a" above but "blend" the discontinutity with some filing.  May change gaging point slightly.  Will this deepen the flange?
	c. Or use techniques of A-004 to find a common tangent between R1 and R2.  Won't be vertical.  May shift gaging point slightly to right (within "tolerance"? 0.001???) Will this deepen the flange?

Step 5: Non-critical radius on tread edge (break the corner)
May be useful for tooling or CNC

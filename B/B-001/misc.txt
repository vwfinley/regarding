# Abstract
- Perplexing
- Disambiguation
- How to you draw accurately with the given dimensions?
- How to construct?
- Parametric CAD?

# Motivation
- Create dimensioned drawing
- Clear drawing prior to fabrication
- Tools, dies, molds



# Machining
- Basic S-4.2 blocky wheel
- RP not standard
- In truth, many profiles are a solution...
- Leading to different unstated interpretatons per manufacturer calling themselves "RP25".
- Most will turn S-4.2 block wheel on lathe...
- ...and round over the flange with file.
- Laborous, not repeatable
- Tooling would assure accuracy from wheel to wheel and speed process.

# Errors
- Units are unstated.  Assuming inches?
- How was the RP25 contour determined? Is there a forumula or was it ad-hoc?  Based upon existing vendor's products?  Interface with track standards?
- OK, D' does vary from D for some codes, but why differentiate between N and N' when no tolerance given?
- Note #2 how was "reasonable tolerance" determined? Based on track standard?
- Note #3 what is meant by Gaging Point? Is related to nmra gauge (inspection tool)? Gauge vs. gage.  
- Note #3 "point of tangency between R1 and R2" implies A-004 Class B single tangent.  (A-003 case 8) Circles are tangent to each other.
- Note #3 "point of crossing of R2 with the inside of the wheel" is not possible since center of R2 is above the "P" line.
- Note #3 is P a point or distance?  Vague.  If distance from/to where?  If distance where is gaging point P?
- Note #4 is vague.  What does "large as possible" mean?  Why not just state some tolerances?
- Note #5 Worn wheels on prototype or model? 
	- Is reverse taper deseriable?
	- Will reverse taper help center?
	- Is reverse table above or below horizontal tread line?
	- Can tread be 0 deg (horizontal)?
- Drawing: Where is the origin?  At the "gaging point" P?
- Drawing: How were construction lines for R1 determined?
- Drawing: Flange depth is geometrically incorrect for stated value of D'.  Flange will be too short.
- Drawing: Is there a tangent line between R1 and R2?  
	- This cannot be vertical as it won't connect to R2.  Discontinuous or require left offset of R2.
- Drawing: Where are centers of R1, R2, R3?
- Drawing: R2 & R3 form ogive.  Thus arc between them centered at bottom of flange (ogive check).
- Drawing: R2 & R3 where are the vertical bi-secting arcs centered?
- Drawing: Why are R2 & R3 arrows shown in different positions?
- Drawing: Right N' vertical line has discontunity where it meets R3.  R3 center above "P" horiz "axis".
- Drawing: shows 0 deg tread slope, can slope also be between 0 and 1?  Disagrees with note 5.

Assuming we want continuous segments, no discontinuities.
analyze in two halves, left & right
straight segment.  vertical?
left: A-001 & A-002 circles, tangent lines & fillets
right: A-006 & A-007 ogives
connecting segment: A-003, 4, 5

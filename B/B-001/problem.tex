\section{Problem}
\paragraph{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Three circles: $C1$, $C2$, $C3$; whose radii are: $R1$, $R2$, $R3$; respectively...
\item with $0 < R1 < R2 = R3$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Find:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Circle center locations: $P1$, $P2$ and $P3$; such that:
\item $C1$ is tangent to the horizontal line passing some distance $P$ above the origin
\item with, $C1$ and $C2$ mutually tangent to each other, at the origin
\item and with, $C2$ and $C3$ intersecting at some location: $P - D'$ below, and $T/2$ to right of; the origin.
\end{enumerate}

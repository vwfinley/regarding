\section{Problem}
How does one draw the RP-25 wheel contour?
Don't think in terms of wheel treads and flanges!
The trick to solving this problem is framing it mathematically.

Reduce the problem to its most fundamental mathematic idea.
Simplify!
The problem of drawing the RP-25 contour is really just a problem of drawing three circles in the correct locations!

\paragraph{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Three circles: $C1$, $C2$, $C3$; whose radii are: $R1$, $R2$, $R3$; respectively...
\item with $0 < R1 < R2 = R3$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Find:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Circle center locations: $P1$, $P2$ and $P3$; such that:
\item $C1$ is tangent to the horizontal line passing some distance $P$ above the origin
\item with, $C1$ and $C2$ mutually tangent to each other, at the origin
\item and with, $C2$ and $C3$ intersecting at some location: $P - D'$ below, and $T/2$ to right of; the origin.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Abstract:}

RP-25 is the NMRA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} recommended practice for manufacture of model train wheels.
The RP-25 document recommends wheel contours and dimensions.

A procedure for drawing the RP-25 wheel contour is presented here.
Furthermore, contour geometry is analyzed and critical points are tabulated.

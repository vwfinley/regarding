NMRA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} RP-25\footnote{Recommended Practice RP-25, July 2009, Copyright 1986-2009, National Model Railroad Association, Inc.,  Designed by: Olesen, Mortimer and Bradley, Updated by D.A. Voss}
is a recommended practice for the fabrication of model train wheels.
The RP-25 document describes recommended wheel contours and dimensions.
Unfortunately, it omits helpful information in favor of brevity. 

A procedure for drawing the RP-25 recommended contour is presented here.
Furthermore, the contour geometry is analyzed in detail.

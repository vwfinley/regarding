\section{Context}
While concise, the RP-25 document can be perplexing.
Discusson of the wheel-contour construction process is absent.
Locations of circle centers are omitted.
Calculation of circle radius values is conspicuously missing.
Important information is implied or leftout.

Understanding 1960s technology aids in understanding the RP-25 document.
Most of the omitted information may have been obvious to technical people, of the early 1960s, when RP-25 was written.
Technology was analog for most of the population.
Systems were designed and drawn with simple drafting tools.
Secondary school graduates would have been well-trained in constructive geometry.
Mechanical design was mainly accomplished by application of Euclidean constructive geometry, rather than algebraic or trigonometric calculation.
Calculations were performed by hand, when required, or perhaps with a sliderule.

Prior to inexpensive digital personal computers and computer aided drawing (CAD), most designwork involved analog drafting tools.
Digial calculators may have substituted later for sliderules, however, designs and drawings were still analog.
Although the current RP-25 (July 2009 version) document is typeset as a *.pdf document, the design is still of the 1960s analog heritage.

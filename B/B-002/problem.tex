\section{Problem}

\paragraph{Given:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item An object with a planar (flat) surface mounted $45\degree$ to the horizontal,
  \item \emph{and} a right-hand coordinate system drawn from some arbitrary starting location on the object's surface plane, with +x axis to the left, +y axis into the page, and +z axis downward,
  \item \emph{and} a right triangle with angles $\theta$, and sides $a$, $b$ of equal length $L$ and a hypotenuse $c$,
  \item \emph{and} a hypotenuse midpoint that coincides with the coordinate system origin,
  \item \emph{and} a distance $d$ from the origin to the vertex of the right angle $\angle{ab}$,
  \item \emph{and} a milling tool with diameter $D$ whose bottom-left corner is at the coordinate origin.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Find:}

\begin{itemize}
\item The distance $t_x$ along the x-axis, and $t_z$ along the z-axis, the milling tool must travel to remove a v-groove in the planar surface for some arbitrary value of $c$.
\item The distance $t_x$ along the x-axis, and $t_z$ along the z-axis, the milling tool must travel to remove a v-groove in the planar surface for some arbitrary distance $d$.
\end{itemize}

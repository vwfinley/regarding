\paragraph{Given:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item An object with a planar (flat) surface mounted $\theta = 45\degree$ to the horizontal.
  \item \emph{and} a coordinate system drawn from some arbitrary starting location on the object's surface plane, with +x axis to the left, +y axis into the page, and +z axis downward.
  \item \emph{and} a right triangle with angles $\theta$, and sides $a$, $b$ of length $L$ and a hypotenuse $c$.
  \item \emph{and} a hypotenuse midpoint that coincides with the coordinate system origin.
  \item \emph{and} a milling tool with diameter $D$ whose bottom-left corner is at the coordinate origin.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Find:}

\begin{itemize}
\item The distance to the left, in the +x direction, the milling tool must travel to remove a v-groove in the planar surface.
\item The downward distance, +z direction, the milling tool must travel to remove a v-groove in the planar surface.
\end{itemize}

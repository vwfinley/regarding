\section{Example}

\paragraph{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A piece of flat steel bar.
\item An endmill (cutting tool) whose diameter $D = 0.75\,inches$ 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Find:}
Methods to mill out a v-groove where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $a = b = L = 0.7\,inches$
\item One setup method is along desired groove centerline.
\item Another setup method promotes depth-only cutting.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Basic Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start by labeling Figure \ref{fig:fig_b} with the values of $D$ and $L$.
\item Calculate the value $L/2 = 0.70 / 2 = 0.35\,inches$ and label the drawing with it, this will be the maximum travel of the cutting tool along the x-axis and z-axis.
\item Locate and scribe the place on surface of the work where the v-grove will be centered.
\item Mount the work at a $\theta = 45\degree$ angle in a vise in the milling machine, with the scribed line parallel to the y-axis.
\item Position the milling machine table so that the scribed line touches the bottom-left corner of the cutting tool.
\item Zero out and Digital Readouts or dial indicators.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Method \#1:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete the Basic Steps above.
\item Turn on the milling machine, make an initial pass along the y-axis.
\item On subsequent passes, advance the cutter leftward in the x-axis until it has traveled a maximum of $L/2 = 0.70 / 2 = 0.35\,inches$ to the left.
\item Advance the depth of cutter downward along the z-axis until it has sunk a maximum of $L/2 = 0.70 / 2 = 0.35\,inches$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Method \#2:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete the Basic Steps above.
\item Now, raise the cutting tool a distance $L/2 = 0.70 / 2 = 0.35\,inches$ along the z-axis.
\item Move the cutting tool leftward a distance $L/2 = 0.70 / 2 = 0.35\,inches$ along the x-axis.
\item Again, zero out and Digital Readouts or dial indicators.
\item Turn on the milling machine, make an initial pass along the y-axis.
\item On subsequent passes, advance the depth of cutter downward along the z-axis until it has sunk a maximum of $L = 0.70\,inches$, (not $L/2 = 0.35\,inches$ here)!!!


\end{enumerate}

\section{Example}

\paragraph{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A piece of flat steel bar stock.
\item An endmill (cutting tool) whose diameter $D = 0.75\,inches$ 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Find:}
Procedure to mill out a v-groove whose groove ``opening'' is $c = 0.825\,inches$.

\paragraph{Basic Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The value of $D = 0.75$ and the input variable is $c = 0.825$, label Figure \ref{fig:fig_a} with the values of $D$ and $c$ (remember $c$ spans the FULL hypotenuse!).
\item On Table \ref{tab:table_a} find the corresponding equation for input variable $c$ (it is equation \#\ref{eqn:t_x_z_035_c}).
\item Input $c = 0.825\,inches$ into equation \#\ref{eqn:t_x_z_035_c}.
\item Calculate:
\begin{align*}
    t_x = t_z &= 0.353553 \cdot 0.825\,inches \\
    t_x = t_z &= 0.2917\,inches
\end{align*}
\item Label Figure \ref{fig:fig_a} with:
\begin{equation*}
    t_x = t_z = 0.2917\,inches
\end{equation*}
\item Scribe a line on surface of the work where the v-grove will be centered.
\item Mount the work at a $45\degree$ angle in a vise, with the scribed line parallel to the y-axis.
\item Position the work so that the scribed line touches the bottom-left corner of endmill.
\item Zero out and Digital Readouts or dial indicators.
\item Turn on the milling machine, make an initial pass along the y-axis.
\item On subsequent passes, advance the cutter leftward along the x-axis until it has traveled a maximum of $t_x = 0.2917\,inches$ to the left.
\item Advance the depth of cutter downward along the z-axis until it has sunk a maximum of $t_x = 0.2917\,inches$.
\item Since:
\begin{align*}
    D &\ge 2 \cdot t_x \\  
    D &\ge 2 \cdot 0.2917 \\
    D &\ge 0.5834
\end{align*}
No additional cleanup cuts are needed to removed missed material before the start point.
\end{enumerate}

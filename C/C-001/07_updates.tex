\section{Software Updates}

You have verified that the network is configured and functional.
While your are still logged into the desktop, it is a great opportunity to update all the software on the system.

There are a couple ways to update.

\subsection{Method 1: Update Graphically}
Ubuntu desktop has an application named Software Updater to make system updates convenient.

You may notice a message box that periodically appears.
It will say ``Updated software is available for this computer.  Do you want to update it now?''.

You can also manually run the Software Updater application by going to: Activities $>$ Software Updater

When prompted, click Install Now.
Be sure to reboot after the update completes.

\subsection{Method 2: Update Commandline}
A better way to update is from the commandline.
This method better supports automation and will work with headless (server) Ubuntu distributions.

First launch a terminal: Activities $>$ Terminal

Then enter the following at the commandline.
\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
\end{verbatim}

You should reboot after the upgrade completes.

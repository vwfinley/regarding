\section{SSH Service}
Most Linux \textbf{server} distributions are already setup for inbound SSH connectivity.
However, Linux \textbf{desktop} distributions are setup to support outbound SSH connections only.
The Ubuntu desktop distribution is no exception.
It is setup to be an SSH client, but not a server.
Inbound SSH support must be setup manually.

\subsection{Install SSH Server}
To install the SSH service on an Ubuntu system\footnote{https://devconnected.com/how-to-install-and-enable-ssh-server-on-ubuntu-20-04/}, open a terminal on alpha and enter the following:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ systemctl status ssh

# If ssh.service is not running, do the following command:
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
\end{verbatim}

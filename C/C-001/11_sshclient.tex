\section{OpenSSH Client}
Keep in mind, SSH (Secure SHell) is a protocol.
The implementation of the protocol has a client and server associated with it.

OpenSSH client should already be installed on Windows 11 by default.
Earlier Windows versions may have it disabled.

If OpenSSH client is unavailable on your laptop, search the internet on how to enable or install it.
You will find the project page here: https://www.openssh.com/

The best way to verify if OpenSSH client is available is to enter the following at the Windows CMD prompt:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ssh
$ where ssh
\end{verbatim}

As part of OpenSSH support for Windows, ssh-keygen commandline utility is probably bundled in.


\subsection{Initial SSH remote login}
In the previous section, you enabled the SSH service on the remote VM named alpha.
Let's test the connection!

\begin{itemize}
  \item On your laptop, open a Windows command shell and do the commands below.
  \item When prompted "Are you sure you want to continue connecting" enter "yes".
  \item Then enter your password for alpha.
\end{itemize}


\begin{verbatim}
C:\Users\vfinl>ssh vfinley@alpha

The authenticity of host 'alpha (10.0.0.246)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:YTJSgWrfm9oppwq+vtpskrQjk0hPw80dJ8xzBAfacOI.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Warning: Permanently added 'alpha' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

vfinley@alpha's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-57-generic x86_64)

Expanded Security Maintenance for Applications is not enabled.

0 updates can be applied immediately.
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Check BASH shell functionality}

Congratulations, you are SSH'd into alpha!
To verify everything is working, enter "ls" at the BASH shell prompt.
Inspect contents of your user directory, it should contain Desktop, Documents, etc. as shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
vfinley@alpha:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures
  Public  snap  ssh  Templates  Videos
\end{verbatim}

Now exit the shell by entering exit.

\begin{verbatim}
vfinley@alpha:~$ exit
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Generate Key}
SSH secures authenticaion and communication by using a public+private key pair.
Using the key pair makes it convenient since you won't need to login everytime you connect to the remote alpha VM.

You wil need to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create the key pair.
  \item Save the pair to your laptop.
  \item Then give the public key to the remote VM named alpha (Ubuntu Desktop). 
\end{itemize}

When asked for a fil in which to save the key, hit Enter to save it to the default location.
When creating the key pair you can set an optional password (or leave it blank) when asked for a passphrase.
If you set a passphrase you will prompted for it once a session when making connections.

Here's how do generate a keypair and copy it to the remote VM named alpha.
On the laptop, at the Windows CMD prompt do the following:
\begin{verbatim}
C:\Users\vfinl> ssh-keygen
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\vfinl/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\vfinl/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\vfinl/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:rp5oKbld4wp4biuWaVsnoALpThqM2x16ud5Poty4xnY vfinl@victor
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
| .               |
|o   .   S        |
|=  o . .         |
|+=o==o+ =        |
|+*XXAO.B .       |
|o*XOYBB..        |
+----[SHA256]-----+

\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Copy Public Key}
Okay, now we need to copy the public key over to the alpha VM.
There are two possible ways to do this.
If you have ssh-copy-id already installed we can use it to copy the key.
Otherwise don't worry, we can copy the key manually.

To copy the key with ssh-copy-id, goto where the keys were generated in the previous subsection.
And do the following:
\begin{verbatim}
C:\Users\vfinl>  cd C:\Users\vfinl\.ssh

C:\Users\vfinl\.ssh> dir

C:\Users\vfinl\.ssh> ssh-copy-id -i id_ed25519.pub vfinley@alpha
\end{verbatim}

To manually copy the public key: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the Windows CMD shell, Goto where the public key was generated in the previous section.
  \item Use the Windows type command to display the line from the .pub file.
  \item Copy the line from the .pub file.
  \item ssh into the alpha remote VM.
  \item Goto the .ssh hidden directory.
  \item Edit or create the file named authorized_keys
  \item Paste the line from the .pub file into the authorized_keys file.
  \item Save the file and quit the editor.
\end{itemize}

Here's an example of how to manually copy the public key.
\begin{verbatim}
# Goto where the ssh keys live.
C:\Users\vfinl>cd .ssh

C:\Users\vfinl\.ssh>dir
 Volume in drive C is Windows-SSD
 Volume Serial Number is 9484-3D6D

# Display the line in the public key file.

# Goto the hidden .ssh directory on alpha, and edit the authorized_keys

logout
Connection to alpha closed.

\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Testing SSH connection with keyed login}
Let's verify that the public SSH key is being used.
At the Windows CMD prompt, you should be able to ssh into the alpha VM.
If you set a passphrase when generating the keypair, you will be prompted for the passphrase.
Otherwise if you left passphrase empty, you will be automatically connected.

\begin{verbatim}
# No passphrase was set.
C:\Users\vfinl>ssh vfinley@alpha
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-59-generic x86_64)
....
....
....
Last login: Tue May 20 10:36:47 2025 from 10.0.0.137

# Type exit to leave ssh and return to Windows CMD prompt.
vfinley@alpha:~$ exit
logout
Connection to alpha closed.

C:\Users\vfinl>
\end{verbatim}

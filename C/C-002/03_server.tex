\section{Ubuntu Server}
Previously article, our guest OS was Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS \textbf{Desktop}.
This time around our guest OS will be Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS \textbf{Server}.

Let's download Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS \textbf{Server} for AMD64 architecture from the Ubuntu project website.
Or download directly from here: https://ubuntu.com/download/server/thank-you?version=22.04.5&architecture=amd64&lts=true

In VirtualBox, or the hypervisor you are using, follow sections 1 thru 4 of the previous article.

Instead of naming the VM "alpha" we will name it "bravo".
Also, when asked how much space to dedicate to storage increase storage to 40Gb or more.
Why? 
Because we will be installing Docker, and our containers are hungry for storage.  

Boot Ubuntu Server in the VirtualBox VM then follow the setup prompts.
vwf tbd: provide info about prompts (choose all defaults?)

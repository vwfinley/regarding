\section{SSH Setup}
If you chose to follow the instructions for the Attended Installation, then you have already installed OpenSSH Server.
Good for you!
You can skip to the next section.

However if you followed the instructions for the Unattended Installation, no worries.
You'll just need to install OpenSSH Server now.
No big deal.

On the Ubuntu Server VM named bravo, goto the Bash shell commandline and enter the following, from section 9.1 of previous article C-001:
\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ systemctl status ssh

# If ssh.service is not running, do the following command:
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
\end{verbatim}

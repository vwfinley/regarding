\section{Cloud Init}
Cloud init assumes Ubuntu Server will be running on a cloud platform.
It wants to setup the server's network to align with a cloud hosting enviroment.

We are not interested in running on a cloud platform, so we will manually setup the network.
To manually setup the network, we need to disable Cloud Init's network setup.

To disable Cloud Init's network setup, let's create a file at /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg containing the following line:
"network: {config: disabled}"

Better yet, run the following script at the command line:
```
echo "network: {config: disabled}" | sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg > /dev/null
```

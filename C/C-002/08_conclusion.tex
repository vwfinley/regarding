\section{Conclusion}
Configuring Ubuntu Server as a remote development environment involves many of the same steps described in the previous article.

The main differences between using Ubuntu server vs. desktop are related to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Server distro installation procedures.
  \item Manual configuration of Netplan.
  \item Override of cloud-init's network auto-setup.
\end{itemize}

Choosing a server distro as development system reduces maintenance cost while increasing developer collaboration.
It also facilitates relocation of the development environment to other hypervisor platforms when needed.

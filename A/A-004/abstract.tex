Understanding how circles and lines join together has always been useful in: surveying, construction, civil engineering and architecture.

When a circle and a line contact at a single point the meeting point is called a ``tangent point''.  

Multiple circles and lines can be joined, at their tangent points, into complex paths or shapes.

This article classifies how pairs of circles can be joined together by tangent lines.

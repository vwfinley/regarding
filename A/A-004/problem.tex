\section{Problem}
A previous article\footnote{\label{noteA003}A-003, Regarding Coplanar Circles, Vincent W. Finley, January 2022} is the foundation for the discussion that follows.  The reader is encouraged to refer to it frequently. 

The ``Given'' section here is repeated from the previous.  However the ``Find'' section here seeks answers to different, yet related, questions. 

\paragraph{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two coplanar circles $A$ and $B$,
  \item \emph{with} center points $C_A$ and $C_B$ respectively,
  \item \emph{and} having radii $r_A$ and $r_B$ respectively,
  \item \emph{where} $r_A < r_B$;
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Find:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The ways $A$ and $B$ can be joined together by tangent lines.
  \item A description of each scenario.
  \item Locations of critical points.
%  \item A classification of the cases described in article\footnotemark[\ref{noteA003}].
\end{enumerate}

When parts need their sharp corners removed: tradesmen, craftsmen and engineers; will either chamfer or fillet the corner.  A chamfer is a straight cut created at an angle between two adjoining sides.  Whereas, a fillet is simply the rounding-off of a part's interior or exterior corners.  Fillets can be concave or convex arcs, usually at the intersection of two straight lines or edges.  A rounded-off table corner, 
a beaded weld between steel plates, a vehicle's path when turning at an intersection, a curved railroad track adjoining two straight sections; are all examples of fillets.

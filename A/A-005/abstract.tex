Equal coplanar circle-pairs occur frequently  in tradework and engineering.

Circle-pairs of equal radii can be considered a special condition of the more general unequal radii condition. 

The ten possible general coplanar circle-pair arrangements are described in a previous article.\footnote{\label{noteA003}A-003, Regarding Coplanar Circles, Vincent W. Finley, March 2022} 

How these ten general cases reduce upon application of the special equal radii condition is considered.
Additionally, effect of the special condition upon circle-pair tangents is
investigated\footnote{\label{noteA004}A-004, Regarding Classification of Coplanar Circle Tangents, Vincent W. Finley, April 2022}.

Arrangements of coplanar circles are frequently encountered in mechanical design.  They are often observed when determining
centers of rotation for: wheels, geartrains and pulley systems.

In the field of astronomy: orbits of planets, solar eclipses and moon transits; can be considered in terms of coplanar circles.

The myriad examples of coplanar circles, both in nature and industry, make their study worthwhile.

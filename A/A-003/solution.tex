\section{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Refer to Figure \ref{fig:fig_b} for the discussion that follows.

\item
Since $A$ and $B$ are coplanar circles, center points $C_A$ and $C_B$ lie in the same plane with the circles.

\item
Two points define the line between them, therefore a line can be drawn between $C_A$ and $C_B$.  This line
shall be coplanar with circles $A$ and $B$, and their centers.

\item
A coordinate system can be drawn in the plane containing $A$ and $B$, and the line between their centers.
For convenience, the coordinate system origin can be arbitrarily chosen to coincide with $C_B$.

\item
Furthermore, for convenience, the coordinate system can be oriented such that the x-axis aligns with the
line connecting $C_B$ and $C_A$.

\item
Since the origin is always relative to $C_B$, $C_B$ will always be at $C_B = (x_B, y_B) = (0, 0)$.

\item
Since the x-axis is aligned with the line connecting $C_B$ and $C_A$, $C_A$ will always lie along the x-axis, such
that:  $C_A = (x_A, y_A) = (x_A, 0)$.

\item
Furthermore, the distance between $C_A$ and $C_B$ will always be $\Delta x = x_A - x_B = x_A - 0 = x_A$

\item
Therefore the problem of finding critical locations of $C_A$ simplifies into the trivial problem of finding critical values of $x_A$.

\item
The locations of $C_A$ relative to $C_B$ can be generalized into the 10 cases shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig_b}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{case 0:}
$x_A = 0$

At the critical point where $C_A$ is at the origin, $C_A$ will be concentric with $C_B$.

\item \textbf{case 1:}
$0 < x_A < r_A$

When $C_A$ lies less than one $r_A$ radius from the origin, $A$ will overlap left and right regions of $B$.

\item \textbf{case 2:}
$ x_A = r_A$

When $C_A$ lies exactly than one $r_A$ radius from the origin, circle $A$ will pass through point $C_B$.

\item \textbf{case 3:}
$r_A < x_A < r_B - r_A$

In this case, $C_A$ overlaps with the right side region of $B$.

\item \textbf{case 4:}
$ x_A = r_B - r_A$

When $C_A$ lies at one $r_A$ radius less than $r_B$, $A$ and $B$ will share a tangent point.  $A$ will overlap with right region of $B$.

\item \textbf{case 5:}
$ r_B - r_A < x_A < r_B$

In this case, $A$ only partially overlaps $B$.  Furthermore it overlaps the right edge of $B$.

\item \textbf{case 6:}
$ x_A = r_B$

$C_A$, the center of $A$, lies on circle $B$.

\item \textbf{case 7:}
$ r_B < x_A < r_B + r_A$

The center of $A$ is beyond the edge of circle $B$.  Circle $A$ partially overlaps the right side of $B$.

\item \textbf{case 8:}
$ x_A = r_B + r_A$

Circles $A$ an $B$ are tangent to each other with no overlap.


\item \textbf{case 9:}
$ x_A > r_B + r_A$

Circle $A$ is entirely outside $B$.  $A$ and $B$ are non-overlapping.

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Study of the Tangent Ogive has useful application in Engineering, especially to aeronautics and ballistics.
Previous investigation described how the Tangent Ogive may be defined by inscribing the ogive upon a circle. 
It also described relationship of the ogive parts.

While fundamental Tangent Ogive analysis is interesting, deeper exploration is desired.
What are its properties? 
More pertinently, how can it be used in other mathematical solutions?

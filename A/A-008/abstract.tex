A circle is fully defined by its radius and center on a plane.
In many design scenarios circle locations and sizes are known requirements, therefore these circles can be immediately placed on the design.

Often, circle radius and center location are initially unknown as they depend upon surrounding geometric features.
A circle inscribed on a triangle is a classic example.

How to: pass a circle through a point and fit it to a tangent line; is described here.
Geometric and trigonometric techniques are presented.

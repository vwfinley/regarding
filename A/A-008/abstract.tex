Circles are fully defined by their radii and center locations on a plane.
In many design scenarios circle locations and sizes are known requirements, therefore these circles are placed first on a design.

Often, circle radius and center location will be totally unknown, and will depend upon surrounding geometric features.
A circle inscribed on a triangle is a classic example.

How to: place a circle on a line, and fit it to a tangent line; is described here.
Geometric and trigonometric techniques are presented.

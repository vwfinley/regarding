Example


Given:
%Line Ls , with slope m = 0.268, passing
%through the origin,
%and horizontal line Lh passing distance h =
%13 above the origin.



Find:
The circle that:
– passes through the origin,
– and is tangent to horizontal line Lh ,
– and has its center somewhere on sloped
line Ls .
A geometric construction locating the circle
on Ls , tangent to Lh and through the origin.
The radius of the circle.
Numeric values for all angles and critical
points.
Steps:

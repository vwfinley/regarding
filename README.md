# Regarding the *"regarding"* repository
- This repository contains my personal notes **regarding** various: topics, interests and hobbies.
- It contains several series of articles **regarding** those various topics.
- Each article is produced as a .pdf file.
- Each series begins with a capital letter.  For example, the series **regarding** mathematics begins with capital **A**.
- The title of each article begins with the word "**Regarding**".
- The id of each article has the capital letter of the series and the order of the article in that series.  For example **A-004**.
- Each series folder in the repo has a README.md file with links to the articles.  You may need to scroll down to see the links.

# Motivation
Upon reviewing my old notebook, I became disappointed with what I found:
- Poor handwriting.
- Notes lacked enough context to decipher my original intent.
- Half-baked ideas.
- Brainstorms were lost and confused.

Going forward, something better was needed:
- Full development and completion of thoughts.
- Supporting background and context. 
- Accurate drawings.
- Clear printing of equations.
- Versioning of changes.
- Durable format.

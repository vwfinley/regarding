# Regarding the "*regarding*" repository
This repository contains my personal notes **regarding** various: topics, interests and hobbies. 

It contains a series of articles **regarding** those various topics.
Each series begins with a capital letter.  For example the series **regarding** mathematics begins with capital **A**.
The title of each article begins with the word "**Regarding**".

# Motivation
Upon reviewing my old notebook, I became disappointed with what I found:
- Poor handwriting.
- Notes lacked enough context to decipher my original intent.
- Half-baked ideas.
- Brainstorms were lost and confused.

Going forward, something better was needed:
- Full development and completion of thoughts.
- Supporting background and context. 
- Accurate drawings.
- Clear printing of equations.
- Versioning of changes.
- Durable format.

# Solution
I began collecting my personal notes and thoughts into short 4-6 page articles.
- LaTeX


My notes regarding various topics.

# Details
- LaTeX typesetting system
- Tikz drawing system

# Software
